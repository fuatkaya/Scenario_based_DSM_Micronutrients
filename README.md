# Scenario_based_DSM_Micronutrients
LATEST and GREAT UPDATE/NEWS: Dear Community, Our article titled "Spatial prediction of soil micronutrients using machine learning algorithms integrated with multiple digital covariates" in the journal Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems was accepted on July 21. Reference information will be added very soon.

This study is in the process of publication preparation in "Advances and applications of multivariate statistics and soil-crop sensing to improve nutrient use efficiency and monitor carbon cycling" special issue in of Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems journal. After the final submission, this page will update. We want to make the peer review process clearly with open access to data and codes. After decision, if the process results in acceptance, article citation information will be added.



Formerly UPDATE: Dear Community, My one of the dearest article has been continue to review process and published preprint on ResearchSquare. Please find link belowed.
